## 🧠 About the Project

This 3D cube spins in a cosmic-themed environment, displaying tech logos on each face. It’s a **portfolio-worthy component** that demonstrates:

- My understanding of **Three.js**, WebGL, and canvas textures.
- Aesthetic skills with **lighting, materials, and animation.**
- The ability to **leverage AI tools efficiently** to reduce development time and tackle challenges like:
  - Lighting setup
  - Texture alignment
  - Cube geometry manipulation
  - 3D interactivity

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Three.js** — 3D rendering
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — logic and interaction
- **HTML/CSS** — layout, animation, and effects
- **Canvas Textures** — dynamically placed logos
- **Custom Geometry** — rounded cube with soft edges
- **AI Collaboration** — ChatGPT & Claude AI helped refine structure, logic, and design choices

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🎲 Interactive 3D cube with developer tech logos
- 🖱️ Mouse drag to rotate, scroll to zoom
- 🔄 Smooth animations and lighting pulse
- 🧠 AI-assisted workflow for rapid development and problem solving

## 🤖 AI-Powered Workflow

This project is a perfect example of **how developers can utilize modern AI tools**:

- **ChatGPT**: Helped me structure logic, resolve rendering issues, optimize performance, and improve visual quality.
- **Claude AI**: Assisted in explaining advanced WebGL behaviors and improving the UI/UX details for a better interactive experience.

By using these tools efficiently, I was able to:
- Cut down hours of research and debugging
- Learn while building in real-time
- Focus on design and user interaction
- Complete complex functionality faster
